## RookieCookie
This is a test app for technical code challenges.

RookieCookie is a Class Management system that allows editors to create and edit classes and easily look them up. The app has a few bugs and a few incomplete features, and your job is to get it all in proper working order.

To complete the task, clone (not fork) the repository, do your work as you normally would, and create a new repository in your Github account. Send the link to the repo to Rajesh at [rajesh_mahajan@discovery.com](rajesh_mahajan@discovery.com) when you're done.

Don't worry about real persistence, this is all client side stuff. Use your best judgement, use whatever tools or NPM packages you need, and implement things in the way that makes the most sense to you.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask! Keep it simple, this is not expected to take up an unreasonable amount of time!

### Bugs to Fix
1. Images on the class cards don't all seem to work as expected. Some cards have them, some don't!
2. Some class cards seem to cut off the text.
3. Class cards should be in an evenly-distributed grid below the nav, but they are currently in a single column with no spacing!
4. Clear the error that is coming up in the console. 

### Features
1. Add a way for a user to create new classes and add them to the list.
2. Add a way for a user to cancel/delete a class.
3. Using your favorite image api, give the user the ability to search for an image for their class. Don't have a favorite? Check out Unsplash, Pixabay, Bing, Giphy, or good ol' Google.

### Bonus
Think of another cool feature to add? Want to play with the design? Feel free to play and show off! No pressure though!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This code challenge was modeled after Scott Reynold's [RecipeBoss App](https://github.com/scottcreynolds/recipeboss)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
